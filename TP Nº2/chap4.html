				<strong>My age is already advanced, but nothing prevents me from continuing the championships of tavern fights, I have won several and lost several more, but this is perhaps the most important of all, because it is where they will decide who is the real champion, I plan to participate And after winning retire in peace and leave room for the new generations, after all, I had much to do in the beginning of this as a sport.</strong>
