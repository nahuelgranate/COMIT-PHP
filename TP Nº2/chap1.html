			<p style="text-indent: 30px;display: block;"><strong> In one of my many nights of work as an object transporter, I stopped one night in a tavern in the middle of the way to rest and dine some meat with a beer, it was a quiet night until a gang of drunks without office began to arm when I realized I was involved in the revolt and started to defend myself as I could, I felt a great adrenaline and I felt like giving them their due, after that night nothing was the same, I began to dedicate myself to remove drunkards in every tavern in the I stopped to rest, many thanked me for it.</strong></p>
